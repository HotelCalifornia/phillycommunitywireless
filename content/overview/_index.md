During a time when every classroom and doctor’s office has moved online, when bearing witness to violence and injustice on the Internet is a matter of life and death, a mere 53% of Black residents and 44% of Latinx residents in Philadelphia have broadband connections.[^1] The Philly Community Wireless Project seeks to address the city's digital divide by building community-owned and -operated mesh networks. [Mesh networks](https://urbanomnibus.net/2019/10/building-the-peoples-internet/) allow a single Internet connection to be shared among a broader group of users with very little cost or infrastructure required.

Our members include community organizers, technologists, researchers, public school teachers, and Philadelphia City Hall staffers. With the help of [PhillyWisper](https://phillywisper.net/), a pro-net neutrality, wireless internet service provider, we are working toward installing two pilot sites in Kensington and Fairhill. From there, we will plan participatory design workshops and technical training for the community that will empower them to maintain and grow this free network connection.
